# CLV-Prediction-Auto
Machine learning project for predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in the auto insurance industry using regression models and feature engineering.

# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction in Auto Insurance ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

Predicting **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** is critical for insurance companies to identify high-value customers, optimize marketing campaigns, and improve customer retention. 
This project leverages **machine learning and data analytics** to estimate the expected revenue from customers over their lifetime and provides a **deployed web interface** for real-time predictions.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **regression-based predictive model** to forecast CLV for customers in the auto insurance sector. The dataset includes customer demographics, policy details, pricing, claims history, and transactional data. By analyzing these features, the model provides actionable insights to help insurance companies **maximize revenue and reduce churn**.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and handled missing values, outliers, and categorical data using encoding and scaling techniques.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful features such as customer tenure, claim frequency, policy premium trends, and risk indicators.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Applied and compared models including **Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor** for accurate CLV prediction.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed performance using **RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score** to ensure reliability.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built using **Streamlit / Power BI** to visualize predictions, customer segments, and business-critical insights.  
- **Deployment**: Project deployed as a **web application** for real-time CLV predictions, enabling stakeholders to input customer data and instantly get results.  
- **Business Impact**: Helps insurance companies identify high-value customers, optimize policy offerings, reduce churn, and plan targeted marketing strategies.
